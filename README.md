A prototype to explore different recovery techniques for the UFS2 filesystem. Specifically for use with PS3/4.

## TODO
- Improve file dumping time.
	- Include progress bar.

- Add an option to scan for inodes and directs accross the whole drive.
- Include PS4 support
- Use Unreal TOC files to identify inodes with no direct.
